## Description
I worked on this project with 2 classmates at the university. BlindCrown is a wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles. Initially, we planned to use vibration motors for feedback. However, due to time constraints and challenges in integrating the Wi-Fi module, we opted for a buzzer instead. The system consists of ultrasonic sensors, a microcontroller, and a buzzer that emits sound based on detected obstacles, helping users navigate their surroundings safely.

All project-related documentation and diagrams can be found in the Docs folder, including:
* **General Aspects:** Overview of key project concepts.
* **Vibration Motors for Haptic Devices and Proximity Sensors:** Initial research on using vibration for feedback, with an alternative approach using sound.
* **Vibration Motor Power Control:** Details on managing vibration motor power (from the initial concept).
* **BlindCrown:** The final project documentation.
